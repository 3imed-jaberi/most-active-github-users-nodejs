# GitHubStats
The project queries the list of active users in GitHub by country using GitHub Graph API on Node.js and the UI is created by using React.js.

## How it works?
Users need to create a GitHub token to fetch the results from GitHub Graph API. The list of countries and the cities are listed in `server.js` as arrays and `GraphQuery.js` fetches the data from GitHub Graph API.
